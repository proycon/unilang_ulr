			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">One fine evening, a young princess put on her bonnet and shoes and went out for a walk by herself in the woods. When she came to a cool spring of water, she sat down to rest a while. She had a golden ball in her hand which was her favourite plaything, and she started tossing it up into the air and catching it again as it fell.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="2">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">After a time, she threw it up so high that she missed catching it, and the ball bounced away. It rolled along the ground until it fell into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep. It was so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry for her loss and said,</attrib>

		<entry id="3">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;Alas! If I could get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels and everything that I have in the world.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="4">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">While she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water and said, &quot;Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="5">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;Alas!&quot; she said, &quot;What can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="6">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The frog said, &quot;I do not want your pearls and jewels and fine clothes. But if you will love me, let me live with you, eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="7">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;What nonsense this silly frog is talking!,&quot; thought the princess, &quot;He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me. So I will tell him he will have what he asks.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="8">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">She said to the frog, &quot;Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.&quot; Then the frog put his head down and dived deep under the water. After a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="9">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up. She was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again that she never thought of the frog. She ran home with her ball as fast as she could.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="10">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The frog called after her. &quot;Princess! Take me with you as you promised!&quot; But she did not stop to hear a word.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="11">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise - tap, tap-plash, plash - as if something was coming up the marble staircase. Soon afterwards, there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="12">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to your true love here! And mind the words that you and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="13">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight, she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="14">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;There is a nasty frog at the door,&quot; she said, &quot;that got my ball for me from out of the spring this morning. I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring, but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="15">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">While she was, speaking the frog knocked at the door again and said:</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="16">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">Open the door, my princess dear,</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="17">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">Open the door to your true love here!</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="18">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">And mind the words that you and I said</attrib>

			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="20">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The king said to the young princess, &quot;As you have given your word you must keep it, so go and let him in.&quot; She did so, and the frog hopped into the room. He went straight on- tap, tap-plash, plash - to the table where the princess sat.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="21">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;Lift me up on chair,&quot; he said to the princess, &quot;and let me sit next to you.&quot; As soon as she had done this, the frog said, &quot;Put your plate nearer to me, so that I may eat out of it.&quot; This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, &quot;Now I am tired. Carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="22">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. &quot;Now, then,&quot; thought the princess, &quot;at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="23">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">But she was mistaken, for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door. The frog came once more, and said:</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="24">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">Open the door, my princess dear,</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="25">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">Open the door to your true love here!</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="26">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">And mind the words that you and I said</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="27">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="28">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">When the princess opened the door, the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, until the morning came. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning, she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="29">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog. He had been fated to wait until some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="30">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">&quot;You have broken his cruel charm,&quot; said the prince, &quot;and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father's kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.&quot;</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="31">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">The young princess, of course, was not long in saying 'Yes' to all this. As they spoke a beautiful coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness. Behind the coach rode the prince's servant, faithful Heinrich, who had mourned the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment for so long and so bitterly that his heart had almost burst.</attrib>
		</entry>
		<entry id="32">
			<attrib type="orth" author="Abavagada">They then took leave of the king and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and happiness, for the prince's kingdom, which they reached safely. There they lived happily for great many years.</attrib>
